Come October, I will start a new chapter in my academic journey by becoming a part of the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.uib.no/fg/ml/130732/maskinl%C3%A6ringsgruppe#){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no){:target="_blank"} (UiB) as a PhD Research Fellow.

I completed my master’s in machine learning at UiB this spring where I focused on improving the stability of tree-based methods under the direction of Associate Professor [Nello Blaser](https://www.uib.no/personer/Nello.Blaser){:target="_blank"} and [Berent Lunde](https://berentlunde.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}, PhD. 

I also hold a master’s in economics from the [University of Agder](https://www.uia.no){:target="_blank"}, specializing in financial economics. In my thesis, I analysed whether the performance of Norwegian fund managers can be attributed to skill or lack thereof supervised by Professor [Valeriy Zakamulin](https://www.uia.no/kk/profil/valeriz){:target="_blank"}.
