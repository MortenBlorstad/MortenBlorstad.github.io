Come October, I will start a new chapter in my academic journey by becoming a part of the machine learning group at the University of Bergen (UiB) as a PhD Research Fellow.

I completed my master’s in machine learning at UiB this spring where I focused on improving the stability of tree-based methods under the direction of Associate Professor [Nello Blaser]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.uib.no/personer/Nello.Blaser)) and Berent Lunde, PhD. 

I also hold a master’s in economics from the University of Agder, specializing in financial economics. In my thesis, I analyse whether the performance of Norwegian fund managers can be attributed to skill or lack thereof supervised by Professor Valeriy Zakamulin.
